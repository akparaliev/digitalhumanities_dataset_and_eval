2. **`does not match` task:**
    The `doesnt_match()` function of Gensim takes a list of words (variable number of words) as input, an finds the one word that doesn't fit into the list.
    Here, we use a list of 4 items -- the algorithm has to find the ONE item that does not belong into the list.
