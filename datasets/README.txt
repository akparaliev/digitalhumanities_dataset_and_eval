Task Types:
    a) Analogy Task
        For example: Robb is to Stark what Cersei is to X (correct: Lannister)


    b) "does not match" task:
    The doesnt_match() function of Gensim takes a list of words (variable number of words) as input, an finds the one word that doesnt fit into the list.
    Let us use a list of 4 items -- the algorithm has to find the ONE item that does not belong into the list.

    To discuss: what "method" to use to add wrong items into the list: random terms? terms that are related (same type)?



    b) IDEAS:
        List of Cities in Westeros
        List of the Free Cities
        People belonging to houses (but this is tricky)

        List of Maesters

        List of Houses (Stark, Lannister, ....) 

        List of Sigil Animals (Kraken, Lion, ..) 
    
        What we can also do:
            use the Wiki for this .. many options

    c) our own task type which uses analogy with multiple correct entries
